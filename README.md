## Project Overview

The Movie Website is a full-stack web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The backend is responsible for handling API requests and managing data, while the frontend provides a user-friendly interface for browsing and viewing movie information.

## Features

- Browse movies by category
- Search for movies
- View detailed information about each movie
